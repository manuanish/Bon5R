  In this page we will look at an example that describes how we might create a Bon5R component.
  <br/>
  ## Creating the `...` component
  Let's begin by locating where the source code for the `Author` component is located. If we navigate to the `components`
  folder we can see that all the built-in components are stored there. Let's take a look at the `components/Author.js`
  <br/>
  <TitleCode title='[...].js'>
  ```jsx
  import * as React from "react";
  import Image from "next/image";

  ...
  ```
  <br/>
  </TitleCode>
  From here we can change the code and make it fit our theme/needs. In this example I have decided to include a way to "map" authors into the component so that more than one author can write a page.

  ### Modified `Author` component
  <TitleCode title="[...].js*">
  ```jsx
  import Image from "next/image";
  import Link from "next/link";

  ...
  ```
  </TitleCode>
  We will now look at how we might use this modified component in our application
  ### Usage
  We can import the component exactly as before and it should work.
  <TitleCode title="[...].mdx">
  ```jsx
  ...
  ```
  </TitleCode>
  <br/>
  This should give us the following
