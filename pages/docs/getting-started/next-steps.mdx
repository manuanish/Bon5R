  --- So you created your first Bon5R - That's awesome! ðŸ¥³ Here are some things you
  may be interested in learning.
  <br />
  ### ðŸ”Œ Next.js page routing Bon5R is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  and so the static page routing is quite similar. If you are unfamilliar with this,
  I suggest that you look into the [routing documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)
  to learn more about how the returned URL and file paths are related.
  <br />
  ### ðŸŽ¨ Tailwindcss directives If you are trying to customize Bon5R, I would strongly
  reccommend learning tailwind classes, directives as it improves the development
  experience tremendously. If you want to learn more, visit the [Tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
  <br />
  ### ðŸ“– MDX Bon5R heavily relies on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and moreover all pages
  are rendered in this format. MDX is quite similar to standard markdown however
  it allows JSX expressions, components inside the text. If you would like to learn
  more about MDX, refer to the [documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/).
