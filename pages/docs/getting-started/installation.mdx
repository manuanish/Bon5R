# Installation

### Prerequisites
For the installation to fully complete, your system will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16+
and you will need to have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 8+. We reccomend using `yarn` but it is also
possible to run the installtion using `npm`.

## Using Create-Bon5R-App
To create a new application we can simply run the command
```
yarn create-bon5r-app my-app
```
<br/>
And the CLI will automatically generate a app called `my-app` in the directory the command was run.
We can now run the command `cd my-app` and then run `yarn dev` to run the server
in development mode. Now when we go to the URL `http://localhost:3000` we can view the website. It should appear as shown below:
