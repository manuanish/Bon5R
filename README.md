## About The Project

<!-- add animation here... -->

There are so many awesome frameworks to create websites out there but all of them require you to spend a substantial amount of time creating the website. I created Bon5R with the intention of allowing users to make their own websites using markdown which speeds up your workflow.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a project website from scratch.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

#### Install `npm`

```sh

```

#### Install `yarn`

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   yarn create bon5r-app my-app
   ```
2. Navigate inside the directory.
   ```sh
