  In this section we we look at how to customize your Bon5R application. There are many ways this can be done, however in the next few pages we broadly discuss some of the main few.
  <br/>
  ### Prerequisites
  #### üé® Tailwindcss directives
  If you are trying to customize Bon5R, I would strongly reccommend learning tailwind classes, directives as it improves the development experience tremendously.
  If you want to learn more, visit the [Tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
  <br/>
  #### ‚öôÔ∏è JS Config
  Take for example we are trying to import the following component
  ```jsx
  import Author from "@components/Author"
  ```

Notice that the import path for the function is **not relative**.
Wherever your MDX file is located in the `/pages` directory the import statement does not change. The settings for this is located in the `jsconfig.json` file.
