  The Post component can be used at the end of the page to convey a small message.
  <br/>
  ## Usage
  We can use the Post component like so:
  <TitleCode title="header.mdx">
  ```jsx
  import Post from "@components/Post";

  <Post
    title="Hello World!"
    date="3/14/15"
    description="This is an example post, demonstrating the power
    of Bon5R. It displays some features that are included in this project."
    href="#"
  />
  ```
  </TitleCode>
  <br/>
  <Alert type="warning">The `href` prop should not be left empty. This may cause errors.</Alert>
  <br/>
  This we be rendered as shown:
  <Demo>
    <Post
      title="Hello World!"
      date="3/14/15"
      description="This is an example post, demonstrating the power
      of Bon5R. It displays some features that are included in this project."
      href="#"
    />
  </Demo>
  <br/>
