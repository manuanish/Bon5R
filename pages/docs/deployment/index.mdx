  ### ðŸš€ Server Providers
  Currently, Bon5R supports three main deployment platforms.
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
  - [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
  - <span className="text-slate-500">Your provider here?</span>

  If you want to know other ways to deploy a Bon5R app/want to add your own provider here, follow these steps:

  - Create an [issue](https://github.com/manuanish/Bon5R/issues) describing your suggestion.
  - Link a pull request to your issue and wait for a code reviewer to pass all checks.

  Contributions are always welcome!
