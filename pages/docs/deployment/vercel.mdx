  Because Bon5R is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), Vercel makes it quite easy
  to deploy a project with just a few clicks. To get deploy your project follow these steps:
  <br/>
  ### Create a Vercel Account
  Before we begin, you must be have a vercel account. You can sign up here: https://vercel.com/signup

{" "}

<br />
### Create a new project You can create a new Vercel project at: https://vercel.com/new

{" "}

<br />
### Import your repository From here, you can import your repository from your GitHub
account and vercel should begin to your application.

#### Note:

Your repository root directory serves as the link to the project e.g if it is `my-bon5r-app`, you can visit
your application at `https://my-bon5r-app.vercel.app`
