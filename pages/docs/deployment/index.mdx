  ### ðŸš€ Server Providers
  Currently, Bon5R supports three main deployment platforms.
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
  - [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
  - <span className="text-slate-500">Your provider here?</span>

#### Contributing

If you want to know other ways to deploy a Bon5R app/want to add your own provider here, follow these steps:

- Create an [issue](https://github.com/manuanish/Bon5R/issues) describing your suggestion.
- Link a pull request to your issue and wait for a code reviewer to pass all checks.

Contributions are always welcome!

  <br/>
  ### Prerequisites
  Before we can deploy our project to the web, we need to have a repository hosted on GitHub that
  your server provider can access.
  <br/>
  <Collapse title="ðŸ“– Create a Github Repository">

#### 1. Initialize Git

Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```shell
git init -b main
```

  <br/>
  #### 2. Commit all changes to `main`
  Run the following command in the root directory of your project:
  ```shell
  git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
  ```
  <br/>
  #### 3. Create a Github Repository
  Run the following command in the root directory of your project:
  ```shell
  gh repo create
  ```
  Follow the prompted steps and your repository should be published on GitHub
  after it is done.
  <br/>
  #### Alternative Methods
  If you want to use GitHub Desktop, or a more interative GUI, I suggest
  you read the docs on Github on [Adding locally hosted code to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
