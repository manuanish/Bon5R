### Prerequisites
To follow the below, you must have already have an initialized app using `create-bon5r-app`. For more instructions, refer to the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) page.

## Editing Pages & Directories
We can now go to the directory `pages/index.mdx` and start editing it. The project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
so the file structure is similar. For more information, refer to the documentation at Next.js.
### Default Directory
```
pages
  |- index.mdx
  |- hello-world.mdx
```
<br/>
The `index.mdx` file will be rendered at the URL [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
whereas the `hello-world.mdx` page will be rendered at the URL [`localhost:3000/hello-world`](http://localhost:3000/hello-world).
<br/>
### Folder Example
If I were to create a new folder, e.g:
```
pages
  |- index.mdx
  |- hello-world.mdx
  |- posts
       |- index.mdx
       |- post-1.mdx
```
<br/>
The file `posts/index.mdx` would be rendered at [`localhost:3000/posts`](http://localhost:3000/posts)
and the file `posts/post-1.mdx` would be rendered at the URL [`localhost:3000/posts/post-1`](http://localhost:3000/posts/post-1)
