  In this page we will discuss the built in Bon5R components. We will broadly go over how to use them and how they work.
  <br />
  ### üõ† Use case
  Consider the following example. Let us say we wanted to use the Author component in our markdown file; we can do this like so:
  <TitleCode title="example.mdx">
  ```jsx
  import Author from "@components/Author";

  <Author
    author="Manu Anish"
    displayName="manuanish"
    date="3/14/15"
  />
  ```
  </TitleCode>
  <br/>
  This we be rendered as the following:
  <Demo>
    <Author
      author="Manu Anish"
      displayName="manuanish"
      date="3/14/15"
    />
  </Demo>
  <br />
  #### ‚öôÔ∏è JS Config
  Notice that the import path for the function is **not relative**.
  Wherever your MDX file is located in the `/pages` directory the import statement does not change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <NextPage
    nextPage="Author"
    previousPage="Next Steps"
    prevHref="/docs/getting-started/next-steps"
    nextHref="/docs/component-docs/author"
  />
</MDXDocs>
