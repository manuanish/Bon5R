  In this page we will look at how to initialize a new bon5r.
  <br/>
  ### Prerequisites
  For everything to run smoothly, your system must already have the following
  dependencies
  - `npm`
  - `yarn`
  <br/>
  #### Installing npm
  To install npm on your system you can run the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
  <br/>

  <Alert type="info">To be able to install yarn, you must have already installed npm on your system.</Alert>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ## Creating your first bon5r
  To do this, we can use the `create-bon5r-app` package.
  <br/>
  #### 1. Setting up the project
  Run the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  yarn create bon5r-app my-app && cd my-app
  ```
  This will automatically setup a new Bon5R in your current directory.

  <br />
  #### 2. Start the server
  To start the development server, we can run the following:
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```
  And thats it! you can view the website at http://localhost:3000.
